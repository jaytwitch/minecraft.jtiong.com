This is a refresh of the existing website - re-written into the Laravel framework; and designed to be much more maintainable.

### Site Features

* blog
* portfolio
    * of projects
    * of websites

I should be able to post a blog entry - and it can be labelled personal, or public; by default when someone reads my blog - posts that
are tagged personal are automatically 'collapsed' and public posts are presented.
